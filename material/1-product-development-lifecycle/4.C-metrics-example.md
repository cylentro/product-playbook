# Metrics Examples

::::present
### Metrics: Case Studies
Applying the framework to real-world product scenarios.

**The Focus:**
* Selection Logic (Insurance Aggregator).
* Engagement Psychology (Pro Dashboard).
* Operational Checklists for PMs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Theory is nothing without implementation.** Use these examples as blueprints for your own project squads.

### Metrics in Action
Real-world applications of the 5-Tier Framework.

* **Cloud Storage Security Hub**: Tactical feature metrics.
* **Pro Dashboard**: Engagement and motivation metrics.
* **Operational Checklist**: The PM's survival guide.
::::

## Example A: Cloud Storage Security Hub (Feature: Advanced Encryption Selection)

*Context: Tracking the effectiveness of the new multi-tier encryption selection UI in the Admin Dashboard.*

::::present
### Case A: Security Hub
Measuring the selection experience from Intent to Stability.

:::cols
:::col
#### The Goals
* **North Star**: Encrypted Data Assets.
* **Key Metric**: **?[Attach Rate](The percentage of total assets that are protected by advanced encryption.)** (%).
* **Leading**: Toggle 'ON' Intent.
:::col
#### The Controls
* **Supporting**: 'Encryption Layer' Details Expand.
* **Trade-off**: Security Depth vs. **?[Latency](The total time-to-access; more encryption layers shouldn't create lag.)**.
* **Guardrail**: **?[Encryption Fail Rate](The percentage of assets that failed to encrypt within 10s. Goal: <0.1%.)**.

::::

| **Tier** | **Metric Name** | **Tactical Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **North Star** | Successfully Encrypted Assets | Measures the core value completion: A user successfully secured an asset with an advanced policy. |
| **Key Metric** | Encryption Attach Rate (%) | The specific "Outcome" of this design: What percentage of total assets now use advanced encryption vs. the default? |
| **Supporting Metric** | 'Encryption Layer' Expand Rate | Measures user engagement with the technical documentation UI. Are users making informed choices? |
| **Leading Indicator** | Security Toggle 'ON' Intent | A predictive signal: A user who toggles advanced security "ON" during upload is 95% likely to complete the process. |
| **Trade-off Metric** | Security Depth vs. Data Access Speed | Does adding triple-AES layers (Security) significantly increase the 'Time-to-Open' (Friction)? |
| **Guardrail Metric** | Encryption Service Timeout Rate | Ensuring technical stability: If the encryption engine takes >500ms, it will negatively impact the user's perceived performance. |

## Example B: Pro Tier (Feature: Resource Usage Dashboard)

*Context: A new in-app dashboard designed to motivate Pro users to utilize their 600GB quarterly compute quota.*

::::present
### Case B: Pro Dashboard
Motivating behavioral shifts through information and rewards.

:::cols
:::col
#### The Goals
* **North Star**: Dashboard **?[DAU](Daily Active Users: The number of unique users who engage with the dashboard in a 24-hour period.)**.
* **Key Metric**: Feature Unlock Rate.
* **Leading**: Weekly Frequency.
:::col
#### The Controls
* **Supporting**: Social 'Share Success'.
* **Trade-off**: Density vs. Focus.
* **Guardrail**: **?[Data Sync Latency](The delay between a backend resource update and its reflection on the user's dashboard.)**.
:::
:::
::::

| **Tier** | **Metric Name** | **Tactical Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **North Star (Local)** | Dashboard Daily Active Users (DAU) | Measures core value: Are Pro-eligible users actually checking their status to guide their usage behavior? |
| **Key Metric (Local)** | Milestone Feature Unlock Rate | Measures the effectiveness of the "Levers": How many users activate the "Advanced Plugin" after 20 projects? |
| **Supporting Metric** | 'Share Success' Social Interaction | Measures "Viral Growth": How many power users are sharing their project milestones with their network? |
| **Leading Indicator** | Avg. Weekly Project Frequency per User | Predictive signal: A user who creates 5+ projects in Week 1 of the quarter is 4x more likely to reach the high-usage goal. |
| **Trade-off Metric** | Information Density vs. Task Success | Does adding "Detailed Resource History" (Value) make it harder for users to find the "Export" button (Task)? |
| **Guardrail Metric** | Backend-Dashboard Data Sync Latency | Accuracy safety net: If the project status on the dashboard lags behind actual state by >1 hour, user trust will decline. |

## Operational Checklist for PMs

::::present
### The PM's Metrics Checklist
Ensuring your measurement plan is bulletproof.

* **Strategic Logic**: Does your Leading Indicator predict the Key Metric?
* **Tech Feasibility**: Can the Guardrail (e.g., Latency) be tracked in real-time?
* **Conflict Resolution**: If Accuracy hurts Speed, which one do we prioritize *now*?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A metric is useless if it doesn't lead to a decision. If you can't answer "What do we do if this number drops?", don't track it.
::::

* **Alignment**: Does your Leading Indicator logically predict the Key Metric (Lagging)?
* **Instrumentation**: Have you confirmed with the Tech Lead that the Guardrail Metric (e.g., API Latency) can be tracked in real-time?
* **Conflict Resolution**: If your Trade-off Metric shows that "Accuracy" is killing "Speed," which one does the team prioritize for this iteration?
