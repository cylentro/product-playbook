# Metrics Examples

::::present
### Metrics: Case Studies
Applying the framework to real-world product scenarios.

**The Focus:**
* Selection Logic (Insurance Aggregator).
* Engagement Psychology (Pro Dashboard).
* Operational Checklists for PMs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Theory is nothing without implementation.** Use these examples as blueprints for your own project squads.

### Metrics in Action
Real-world applications of the 5-Tier Framework.

* **Shipping Insurance Aggregator**: Tactical feature metrics.
* **Anteraja Pro Dashboard**: Engagement and motivation metrics.
* **Operational Checklist**: The PM's survival guide.
::::

## Example A: Shipping Insurance Aggregator (Feature: Premium Selection & Coverage)

*Context: Tracking the effectiveness of the new multi-vendor insurance selection UI in the AMA App.*

::::present
### Case A: Insurance Aggregator
Measuring the selection experience from Intent to Stability.

:::cols
:::col
#### The Goals
* **North Star**: Insured Transactions.
* **Key Metric**: **?[Attach Rate](The percentage of total orders that include an insurance policy.)** (%).
* **Leading**: Toggle 'ON' Intent.
:::col
#### The Controls
* **Supporting**: 'Coverage Details' Expand.
* **Trade-off**: Accuracy vs. **?[Speed](The total time-to-checkout; providing more choices shouldn't create paralysis.)**.
* **Guardrail**: **?[API Latency](The time it takes for the system to fetch rates from external vendors. Goal: <500ms.)**.

::::

| **Tier** | **Metric Name** | **Tactical Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **North Star** | Successful Insured Transactions | Measures the core value completion: A user successfully paid for an order with an active insurance policy. |
| **Key Metric** | Insurance Attach Rate (%) | The specific "Outcome" of this design: What percentage of total orders now include insurance vs. the previous single-vendor version? |
| **Supporting Metric** | 'Coverage Details' Expand Rate | Measures user engagement with the educational UI. Are users making informed choices or just clicking past? |
| **Leading Indicator** | Insurance Toggle 'ON' Intent | A predictive signal: A user who toggles insurance "ON" in the initial order screen is 90% likely to complete the purchase. |
| **Trade-off Metric** | Selection Transparency vs. Checkout Speed | Does providing 3 vendor options (Accuracy) significantly increase the 'Time-to-Checkout' (Friction)? |
| **Guardrail Metric** | Premium Calculation API Timeout Rate | Ensuring technical stability: If the aggregator takes >500ms to fetch rates, it will negatively impact the overall AMA checkout experience. |

## Example B: Anteraja Pro (Feature: Quarterly Progress Dashboard)

*Context: A new in-app dashboard designed to motivate Retail users to reach the 60-order quarterly threshold.*

::::present
### Case B: Anteraja Pro Dashboard
Motivating behavioral shifts through information and rewards.

:::cols
:::col
#### The Goals
* **North Star**: Dashboard **?[DAU](Daily Active Users: The number of unique users who engage with the dashboard in a 24-hour period.)**.
* **Key Metric**: Reward Redemption.
* **Leading**: Weekly Frequency.
:::col
#### The Controls
* **Supporting**: Social 'Share Progress'.
* **Trade-off**: Density vs. Success.
* **Guardrail**: **?[OMS Sync Latency](The delay between a real-world shipment update in the Order Management System and its reflection on the user's dashboard.)**.
:::
:::
::::

| **Tier** | **Metric Name** | **Tactical Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **North Star (Local)** | Dashboard Daily Active Users (DAU) | Measures core value: Are Pro-eligible users actually checking their status to guide their shipping behavior? |
| **Key Metric (Local)** | Milestone Reward Redemption Rate | Measures the effectiveness of the "Levers": How many users claim the "Tier 1" voucher after 20 orders? |
| **Supporting Metric** | 'Share Progress' Social Interaction | Measures "Viral Growth" within the SME segment: How many sellers are sharing their Pro status with peers? |
| **Leading Indicator** | Avg. Weekly Shipping Frequency per User | Predictive signal: A user who ships 5+ items in Week 1 of the quarter is 4x more likely to reach the 60-order goal. |
| **Trade-off Metric** | Information Density vs. Task Success | Does adding "Detailed Shipping History" to the dashboard (Value) make it harder for users to find the "Claim Reward" button (Task)? |
| **Guardrail Metric** | OMS-Dashboard Data Sync Latency | Accuracy safety net: If the order count on the dashboard lags behind the actual shipment status by >1 hour, user trust will decline. |

## Operational Checklist for PMs

::::present
### The PM's Metrics Checklist
Ensuring your measurement plan is bulletproof.

* **Strategic Logic**: Does your Leading Indicator predict the Key Metric?
* **Tech Feasibility**: Can the Guardrail (e.g., Latency) be tracked in real-time?
* **Conflict Resolution**: If Accuracy hurts Speed, which one do we prioritize *now*?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A metric is useless if it doesn't lead to a decision. If you can't answer "What do we do if this number drops?", don't track it.
::::

* **Alignment**: Does your Leading Indicator logically predict the Key Metric (Lagging)?
* **Instrumentation**: Have you confirmed with the Tech Lead that the Guardrail Metric (e.g., API Latency) can be tracked in real-time?
* **Conflict Resolution**: If your Trade-off Metric shows that "Accuracy" is killing "Speed," which one does the team prioritize for this iteration?
