# Module 4: Metrics Examples

## Example A: Shipping Insurance Aggregator (Feature: Premium Selection & Coverage)

*Context: Tracking the effectiveness of the new multi-vendor insurance selection UI in the AMA App.*

| Tier | Metric Name | Tactical Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. North Star (Local) | Successful Insured Transactions | Measures the core value completion: A user successfully paid for an order with an active insurance policy. |
| 2. Key Metric (Local) | Insurance Attach Rate (%) | The specific "Outcome" of this design: What percentage of total orders now include insurance vs. the previous single-vendor version? |
| 3. Supporting Metric | 'Coverage Details' Expand Rate | Measures user engagement with the educational UI. Are users making informed choices or just clicking past? |
| 4. Leading Indicator | Insurance Toggle 'ON' Intent | A predictive signal: A user who toggles insurance "ON" in the initial order screen is 90% likely to complete the purchase. |
| 5. Trade-off Metric | Selection Transparency vs. Checkout Speed | Does providing 3 vendor options (Accuracy) significantly increase the 'Time-to-Checkout' (Friction)? |
| 6. Guardrail Metric | Premium Calculation API Timeout Rate | Ensuring technical stability: If the aggregator takes >500ms to fetch rates, it will negatively impact the overall AMA checkout experience. |

## Example B: Anteraja Pro (Feature: Quarterly Progress Dashboard)

*Context: A new in-app dashboard designed to motivate Retail users to reach the 60-order quarterly threshold.*

| Tier | Metric Name | Tactical Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. North Star (Local) | Dashboard Daily Active Users (DAU) | Measures core value: Are Pro-eligible users actually checking their status to guide their shipping behavior? |
| 2. Key Metric (Local) | Milestone Reward Redemption Rate | Measures the effectiveness of the "Levers": How many users claim the "Tier 1" voucher after 20 orders? |
| 3. Supporting Metric | 'Share Progress' Social Interaction | Measures "Viral Growth" within the SME segment: How many sellers are sharing their Pro status with peers? |
| 4. Leading Indicator | Avg. Weekly Shipping Frequency per User | Predictive signal: A user who ships 5+ items in Week 1 of the quarter is 4x more likely to reach the 60-order goal. |
| 5. Trade-off Metric | Information Density vs. Task Success | Does adding "Detailed Shipping History" to the dashboard (Value) make it harder for users to find the "Claim Reward" button (Task)? |
| 6. Guardrail Metric | OMS-Dashboard Data Sync Latency | Accuracy safety net: If the order count on the dashboard lags behind the actual shipment status by >1 hour, user trust will decline. |

## Operational Checklist for PMs

1. Alignment: Does your Leading Indicator in Module 4 logically predict the Key Metric (Lagging) from Module 3?
1. Instrumentation: Have you confirmed with the Tech Lead that the Guardrail Metric (e.g., API Latency) can be tracked in real-time?
1. Conflict Resolution: If your Trade-off Metric shows that "Accuracy" is killing "Speed," which one does the team prioritize for this iteration?
