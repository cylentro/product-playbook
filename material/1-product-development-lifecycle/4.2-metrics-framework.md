# Metric Framework Deep-Dive

To build a "crystal clear" playbook, we must distinguish between the "Cause," the "Effect," and the "Safety Nets."

## Case Study: Anteraja Pro

Context: A loyalty tier for users who complete 60+ orders per quarter, offering exclusive vouchers and rewards.

### 1. North Star Metric (The Value Indicator)

Definition: The single highest-level metric measuring the core value the customer receives.

Case Example: Total Successful Deliveries by Pro Users.

Why: If Pro users aren't successfully shipping packages, the status and rewards are meaningless. This is the ultimate proof of value.

### 2. Key Metrics (The Business Goals)

Definition: High-level outcomes tied to financial health or market share.

Case Example: Quarterly TPV (Total Processing Value) from Pro Segment.

Why: This shows leadership how much the high-usage tier is contributing to the company's bottom line.

### 3. Supporting Metrics (The Levers)

Definition: Metrics that "feed" the North Star. They help you find which specific part of the engine needs tuning.

Case Example: Pro Voucher Redemption Rate.

Why: If the North Star (deliveries) is down, we check this. Are users not shipping because they find the "Pro" rewards unappealing or too hard to use?

### 4. Trade-off Metrics (The Strategic Choice)

Definition: Two metrics that move in opposite directions. You track these to balance the strategy.

Case Example: Reward Depth (Discount %) vs. Contribution Margin.

Logic: We can give massive discounts to grow the Pro segment (Growth), but it will eat into our profit (Viability). We must find the "sweet spot" where both are healthy.

### 5. Counter / Guardrail Metrics (The Safety Net)

Definition: Metrics that ensure you don't "cheat" your way to a goal or break the system.

Case Example: Suspicious/Dummy Order Rate.

Logic: If users create fake orders just to hit the "60-order rule" and get rewards, our North Star looks great, but our business is losing money. The Guardrail flags this "gaming" behavior immediately.

|Leading|# of Users with 20+ shipments in Month 1|Predicting who will hit the Pro tier.|
|Supporting|Pro-Exclusive Voucher ROI|Checking the effectiveness of the reward.|
|Trade-off|Customer Acquisition Cost vs. LTV|Balancing growth spend against long-term value.|
|Guardrail|Support Tickets per 100 Pro Orders|Ensuring high volume doesn't result in low quality.|

## Leading vs. Lagging Indicators (Cause vs. Effect)

### Lagging Indicator (The Past / The "Final Score")

Definition: Measurements of a result that has already occurred. These metrics are easy to measure accurately but impossible to influence after the fact. They tell you how you did.

Case Example: Quarterly Pro-User Churn Rate.

Problem: By the time we see a user has lost their Pro status, they’ve already stopped shipping with us. You cannot change this number once it is recorded.

### Leading Indicator (The Future / The "Weather Forecast")

Definition: Predictive measurements that signal whether you are on track to achieve your goal. These are activities or inputs that happen before the final result. They are harder to identify but allow you to change the outcome today.

Case Example: Number of Users reaching 40+ Shipments by Month 2.

Logic: These users are on track to hit the 60-order rule. If this number is high, we can predict a "Lagging" revenue growth next quarter. If it's low, we can intervene with a promotion or reminder today before the quarter ends.
